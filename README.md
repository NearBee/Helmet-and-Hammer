## Helmet and Hammer
This is one of my first few ongoing projects for practice.

---

Helmet and hammer is a more complex version of rock, paper and scissors.
You'll first be asked to input a player name, which after you'll be approached by your first opponent.  

Once combat initializes you'll be able to see your Player's health as well as the opponent's health and a list of options to choose from to proceed through combat.  

After combat is resolved, whether the opponent wins or the player wins the information will then be added to a counter represented as, Wins, Losses, and Total Battles.  

Your player gets three total lives (or losses) before the program presents you with a "Game Over" screen which will then give you your player Win/Losses as well total battles.
